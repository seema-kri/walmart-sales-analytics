# 🛒 Walmart Sales Analytics 

🚀 Built a production-ready BI system analyzing **$764M in retail data** to drive executive decision-making.

## 🚨 Why This Project Stands Out

Most portfolios show *analysis*. This project demonstrates **business impact, scalability, and decision-making clarity**.

✔ Built like a real-world BI system used by enterprise teams 

✔ Processes **550,000+ transactions** across multiple dimensions 

✔ Answers **critical business questions executives actually ask** 

✔ Delivers a **decision-ready dashboard — not just charts**

## 💼 Business Problem

Retail leaders lack a **single source of truth** to answer:

* Why has revenue plateaued?
* Which categories are growing vs declining?
* Where are we losing market share?
* Who are our most valuable customers and employees?

This project solves that.

## 🧠 What I Built

A complete **end-to-end BI pipeline** — from raw data to executive insights:

### 🔹 Data Engineering (Python · pandas)

* Cleaned **550K+ rows** with real-world inconsistencies
* Removed duplicates, handled nulls, standardized formats
* Ensured **referential integrity across 5 tables**

### 🔹 Data Warehouse (PostgreSQL)

* Designed a **star schema (1 fact + 4 dimensions)**
* Enabled scalable analytics using SQL joins & indexing

### 🔹 Advanced Analytics (SQL + Python)

* Built **15 business-critical queries**
* Used **window functions (LAG, RANK, DENSE_RANK)**
* Performed trend, cohort, and performance analysis

### 🔹 Executive Dashboard (Power BI)

* 3 interactive pages
* 20+ DAX measures
* Time intelligence (YoY, MoM, Rolling 12M)
* Drill-down capability for decision-makers

  👉 Reallocate investment

### 👥 Customer Imbalance

* Top 10 customers = **100% Consumer segment**
  👉 B2B underdeveloped (**$367M gap**)

### 🧑‍💼 Employee Gap

* Top performer = **2.25× average**
